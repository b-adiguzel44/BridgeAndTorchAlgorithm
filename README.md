## Bridge and Torch Problem

The bridge and torch problem (also known as The Midnight Train[1] and Dangerous crossing[2]) is a logic puzzle that deals with four people, a bridge and a torch. It is in the category of river crossing puzzles, where a number of objects must move across a river, with some constraints.[3]

## Story

Before Scrat ate the acorn, he and his three friends, whom he met, want to cross over the tree trunk that fell on a small stream formed by the melting of the glaciers, but they only have one acorn with them and they believe that when they cross the water, if they do not have an acorn with them, the water will rise and not allow them to pass to the other side. but they can instinctively understand that the tree trunk has the strength to bear the weight of only two Cronopios. If Scrat and his friends could pass over the tree trunk alone, they could pass in 10, 12, 15 and 14 seconds respectively, but since they have one acorn, they can cross the road in pairs by sharing the existing acorn, and one of them must return to pass the other friend to the opposite side. While Scrat and his friends are making this journey, Diego tries to calculate the shortest and longest crossing times in how many seconds this journey will be completed by watching from afar. Can you help Diego calculate the times?
